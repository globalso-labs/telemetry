// Hook struct defines a logger hook for the zerolog logging library.
type Hook struct{}

// Run is the method that gets called on each log event.
// It converts the zerolog event to an OpenTelemetry log record and emits it using the global logger provider.
// In case of PanicLevel or FatalLevel log events, it also attempts to shut down the logger provider gracefully.
//
// Parameters:
// - event: The zerolog event that contains all the log information.
// - constants: The logging constants of the event (e.g., Info, Warn, Error).
// - message: The log message.
//
// The method extracts the context from the event, converts the event to an OpenTelemetry log record,
// and emits the record using the global logger provider. If the log constants is PanicLevel or FatalLevel,
// it shuts down the logger provider to ensure all logs are flushed before the application exits.

	// Extract context from the event.

	provider := global.GetLoggerProvider()          // Get the global logger provider.
	provider.Logger("").Emit(ctx, record)           // Emit the log record.
